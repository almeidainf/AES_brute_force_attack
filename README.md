AES_brute_force
===============

Breaking an AES key through multithreaded brute force and Intel AES-NI.

- Read Desafio5.txt for documentation about the software architecture and strategies, as well more information on how we reach high performance on braking the AES Key.
- Read code/README.txt for more information on compiling and running.

Both documentation files are in Portuguese, but the code should be pretty straightforward. Check mainly the file code/main.c.
